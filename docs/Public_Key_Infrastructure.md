A PKI is a system for the creation, storage, and distribution of digital certificates which are used to verify that a particular public key belongs to a certain entity.

- Certificate authority (**CA**): stores, issues and signs the digital certificate
- Registeration authority (**RA**): verifies the identity of entities requesting their digital certificates to be stored at the CA
