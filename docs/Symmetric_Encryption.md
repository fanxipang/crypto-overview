Symmetric Encryption ues the same key for encrypting and decrypting

There are two types of symmetric encryption: 

- **stream ciphers** such as `RC4, A5/1`: produce a pseudo-random stream of bits that you XOR with your plaintext
- and, **block ciphers** such as `DES, AES`: used to encrypt data one block at a time

Since symmetric encryption has a better performance and faster speed (compared to asymmetric), it is typically used for encrypting large amount of data, e.g. for database encryption.

## AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

AES is a replacement of DES (Data Encryption Standard) since DES's key size is too small and its algorithm is not effective.

AES follows a block cipher algorithm that it splits the plain text into small blocks with a fixed size (equals with AES's secret key). Each block is sequencely ecrypted (using XOR) by the key.
